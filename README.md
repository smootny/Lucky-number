### Overview

This project is a simple web-based game that challenges users to guess a randomly generated number between 0 and 10. The interface allows users to increment or decrement their guessed number using buttons, and then check if they guessed correctly. The game provides feedback to the user, indicating whether their guess was too high, too low, or correct.

### Features

- **User-Friendly Interface:** The interface features a clean, minimalist design with a gradient background and centered content.
- **Interactive Elements:** Users can increment or decrement their guessed number using `+` and `-` buttons, which adjust the value displayed in a read-only text field.
- **Game Logic:** Upon clicking the "SprawdÅº, czy wygraÅ‚em ðŸ¤”" button, the game checks the user's guessed number against a randomly generated target number and displays a message indicating the result.
- **Visual Feedback:** The game provides immediate feedback with color-coded messagesâ€”red for incorrect guesses and green for a correct guess.

### Technologies Used

- **HTML:** For structuring the content and layout.
- **CSS:** For styling the page, including a gradient background, styled buttons, and responsive layout.
- **JavaScript:** For implementing game logic, including number generation, event handling, and user interaction.

### File Structure

- `index.html`: Contains the HTML structure and links to the CSS and JavaScript files.
- `style.css`: Provides the styling for the application, including layout, button styles, and responsive design.
- `script.js`: Implements the game's logic and interaction functionality.

### Future Enhancements (welcomed)

- Adding a reset button to generate a new random number without refreshing the page.
- Enhancing the UI with animations for better user experience.
- Extending the game to include a range of numbers chosen by the user.
